## PRODUCTS CRUD

CRUD with express 

**Try clone this repository and use npm install to install project dependencies**

## Use npm start command to start server

**Routes:** <br/>
    - **/create** is a POST where you should pass name not null, description allow null, price allow null <br />
    - **/list** is a GET where list all products <br />
    - **/list/:id** is a GET where list product by Id <br />
    - **/delete/:id?** is a DELETE where delete product by Id <br />

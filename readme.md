PROJECTS CRUD

crud with express 

try clone this repository and use npm to install dependencies

## Use npm start command to start server

**Routes:** 
    - /create is a POST where you should pass name not null, description allow null, price allow null
    - /list is a GET where list all products
    - /list/:id is a GET where list product by Id
    - /delete/:id? is a DELETE where delete product by Id
    - /edit is a UPDATE where edit product by Id


this is my first express and node js by my own, just reading and search for help when found in trouble
